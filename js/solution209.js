// There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

// number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
// distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
// width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
// Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).


function pillars(numPill, dist, width) {
    return numPill > 1 ? (((numPill-1) * (dist*100))+((numPill-2) *width)) : 0
  }

console.log(pillars(11, 15, 30))
