// Scenario
// Several people are standing in a row divided into two teams.
// The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1, and so on.

// Task
// Given an array of positive integers (the weights of the people), return a new array/tuple of two integers, where the first one is the total weight of team 1, and the second one is the total weight of team 2.

// Notes
// Array size is at least 1.
// All numbers will be positive.
// Input >> Output Examples
// rowWeights([13, 27, 49])  ==>  return (62, 27)
// Explanation:
// The first element 62 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 27 is the total weight of team 2.

// rowWeights([50, 60, 70, 80])  ==>  return (120, 140)
// Explanation:
// The first element 120 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 140 is the total weight of team 2.

// rowWeights([80])  ==>  return (80, 0)
// Explanation:
// The first element 80 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 0 is the total weight of team 2.

function rowWeights(array){
  let firstTeam = 0
  let secondTeam = 0
  for( let i = 0; i < array.length ; i++){
    if(i%2 == 0){ firstTeam += array[i]}
    else {secondTeam += array[i]}
  }
  return [firstTeam, secondTeam]
}

console.log(rowWeights([50,60,70,80]))
